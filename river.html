                <h1>River of Thoughts</h1>
            <p>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) focuses
                on changing our relationship with thoughts rather than 
               the content of thoughts themselves. In ACT, thoughts
                are viewed as products of the mind, not necessarily
                reflective of reality. Instead of trying to control or
                eliminate unwanted thoughts, ACT teaches individuals
                to accept them non-judgmentally and allow them to
                come and go without getting entangled in them. By
                fostering psychological flexibility, ACT empowers 
               individuals to choose actions aligned with their values,
                even in the presence of difficult thoughts and 
               emotions. This approach encourages a shift from
                struggling against thoughts to living a rich and 
               meaningful life despite their presence.</p>
