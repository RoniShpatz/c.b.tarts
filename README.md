The project concept is a website that introduces CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) art therapy to everyone, offering the opportunity to try games based on CBT therapy concepts. The website includes two tests to assess mental stability, providing users with more information about themselves. The games are actually methods of CBT therapy.

1.What That Emotion - Generates random emotions for the user to identify and explore.
2.Wheel of Solutions - Invites the user to bring a problem and offers a variety of solutions. The user can conduct a lottery to "win" the chosen solution.
3.River of Thoughts - Allows the user to observe their thoughts floating on a river. The user can also use a timer to write as many thoughts as they can within one minute.
4.Calm Game - A game designed to release anxiety through 10-second intervals of slow breathing. The user can choose either a male or female illustration to guide the breathing practice.
5.Let's Rate - Allows the user to pick a topic, such as "Friends in class," and rate them from 0 to 10 (0 - not a friend, 10 - best friend). Ratings can be dragged and dropped to the desired value. On a phone, users can touch and drag to set the rating, while double-tapping deletes the rating (double-clicking on a computer).
