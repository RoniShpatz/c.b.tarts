            <h1>Rating Systems: An Overview</h1>
            <p>Rating systems are commonly used to evaluate performance, quality, or satisfaction across various contexts. One such system 
                is the "C.B.T" grading scale, which assigns scores from 1 to 10. This scale is designed to provide a comprehensive and nuanced
                 assessment, where each score corresponds to a specific level of achievement or satisfaction. A score of 1 typically indicates 
                the lowest possible rating, reflecting significant shortcomings or dissatisfaction. Conversely, a score of 10 represents the highest
                 rating, indicating exceptional performance or quality. Scores in between these extremes allow for a detailed differentiation 
                between varying levels of competence or satisfaction, enabling more precise evaluations and feedback.</p>
            <p>In the context of the C.B.T rating system, the scale is not just about numerical scores but also about understanding the 
                criteria behind each grade. "C" stands for criteria, which defines the standards or benchmarks being assessed. "B" represents 
                the baseline, the average or expected level of performance or quality. "T" stands for target, the desired or goal level that
                 the entity being rated aims to achieve. By breaking down the rating process into these components, the C.B.T system ensures
                 that each score is backed by clear, measurable criteria, making the ratings more transparent and objective. This structured 
                approach helps in identifying areas of improvement, setting realistic goals, and ultimately driving better performance or quality in
                 the evaluated context.</p>
