        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm an art therapist with a background in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and psychotherapy. My passion lies in using 
            art as a medium for healing and self-expression. Through my practice, I aim to facilitate a safe and supportive environment
             where individuals can explore their emotions, thoughts, and experiences through creative expression.
        </p>
        <p>Combining the principles of CBT with art therapy allows me to help clients identify and challenge negative thought patterns 
            and behaviors while harnessing the transformative power of artistic expression. I believe in the inherent healing potential
             of art and its ability to access deep-seated emotions and facilitate personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>My approach is client-centered and collaborative, tailoring therapy to meet the unique needs and goals of each individual.
             Whether it's through painting, drawing, sculpting, or other creative techniques, I work alongside my clients to unlock 
             their inner strengths and foster positive change.
        </p>
        <p>Ultimately, my goal as an art therapist with a CBT perspective is to empower individuals to discover their own innate 
            resources for healing and self-discovery, leading to greater self-awareness, resilience, and well-being.</p>
